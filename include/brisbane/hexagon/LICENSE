In the instance where QTIL or its designated Affiliate elects to provide a Support Services Quote, such Support Services Quote shall be valid for a period of thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the Support Services Quote during which time QTIL or its designated Affiliate, as the case may be, shall have the right, at any time, to cancel or modify such Support Services Quote provided Support Services PO Acceptance has not yet occurred. “Support Services PO Acceptance” means the date on which QTIL or its designated Affiliate, as the case may be, has accepted in writing (e-mail is acceptable) the purchase order issued by LICENSEE in response to a Services Support Quote. If LICENSEE subsequently elects to cancel a purchase order for Support Services once Support Services PO Acceptance has occurred, LICENSEE shall be required to pay a cancellation fee to QTIL or its designated Affiliate, as the case may be, equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the fees due QTIL or its designated Affiliate, as the case may be, under such purchase order being cancelled. In addition, LICENSEE expressly acknowledges and agrees that for each and every LICENSEE purchase order for Support Services:

a) QTIL or its designated Affiliate, as the case may be, shall have no obligation to provide, and LICENSEE shall have no right to receive, any Support Services associated with such purchase order until such time that both (i) Support Services PO Acceptance has occurred and (ii) QTIL or its designated Affiliate, as the case may be, has received payment in full for the associated Support Services Fee;

b) Such Support Services shall be limited to the PKLA Product Kit(s) referenced, if any, in the associated Support Services Quote and LICENSEE may only use such Support Services in conjunction with LICENSEE’s use of such PKLA Product Kit(s) in LICENSEE Products that incorporate one (1) or more items within such PKLA Product Kit(s);

c) All such Support Services shall be provided subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;

d) All such Support Services will be provided by QTIL or its designated Affiliate remotely, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties;

e) QTIL may, at its sole option, provide such Support Services through an Affiliate; and

f) In the event of a conflict between the terms of the applicable Support Services Quote or this Agreement and the LICENSEE purchase order for Support Services, the terms of the applicable Support Services Quote or this Agreement, as the case may be, will prevail over any conflicting provision(s) in the LICENSEE purchase order for Support Services.

Unless otherwise specified in a Support Services Quote, QTIL or its designated Affiliate, as the case may be, shall issue an invoice for the full amount of the Support Services Fee for the associated Support Services following Support Services PO Acceptance, and said Support Services Fee shall then be due and payable by LICENSEE upon its receipt of said invoice and must be paid in full prior to QTIL or its designated Affiliate, as the case may be, providing such Support Services. Amounts not paid when due will bear interest at the lesser of a rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest rate permitted by applicable law. In addition, in the event QTIL or its designated Affiliate, as the case may be, does not receive the Support Services Fee in full within thirty (30) calendar days after the invoice date, QTIL or its designated Affiliate, as the case may be, shall also have the right thereafter to revoke acceptance of and cancel the associated LICENSEE purchase order for Support Services.

Upon receipt by QTIL or its designated Affiliate, as the case may be, of the income tax withholding certificate, the portion of the invoice represented by the income tax withholding certificate will be deemed fully paid. If LICENSEE fails to withhold taxes, tariffs or governmental charges from any payment due QTIL or its designated Affiliate, as the case may be, where withholding is required by applicable law, QTIL or its designated Affiliate, as the case may be, shall have no obligation to reimburse LICENSEE for such unwithheld taxes, tariffs or governmental charges, unless LICENSEE requests reimbursement from QTIL or its designated Affiliate, as the case may be, in writing within ninety (90) calendar days after the applicable invoice date.

Parts 730-774.

In the event that any of the foregoing LICENSEE certifications is, or hereafter becomes, incorrect, this license to the PKLA Product Kit shall be invalid, and any further use of the PKLA Product Kit by LICENSEE will constitute a breach of this Agreement and a violation of QTIL's and its licensors' intellectual property rights.

In addition, LICENSEE acknowledges that the Development Hardware and Software Support Tools provided under this Agreement are not consumer devices and are neither designed nor certified for compliance with any rule, regulation, law or directive that pertains to commercially available consumer devices.

Such updates shall not be deemed to be an addition or modification requiring written amendment per Section 15 (Miscellaneous Provisions).

A PKLA Product Kit may include MPEG Layer-3 audio decoding technology. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the delivery of a PKLA Product Kit does not convey a license nor imply any rights to use MPEG Layer-3 audio decoding technology in any finished product under any patents or other intellectual property rights of a third party.

Pursuant to QUALCOMM Incorporated’s settlement agreement with Broadcom Corporation, QTIL is required to notify you that the sale, license, or other transfer of certain Components to LICENSEE does not convey to LICENSEE any intellectual property rights (including patent rights) of Broadcom Corporation or any of its affiliates in such Components and therefore LICENSEE should not assume that any such sale, license, or other transfer conveys any such rights to LICENSEE. LICENSEE should contact QTIL with any questions it may have regarding whether QTIL's sale, license, or other transfer of such Components to LICENSEE conveys to LICENSEE any rights to Broadcom intellectual property. For those Components for which this sale, license, or other transfer does not convey to LICENSEE any intellectual property rights of Broadcom Corporation or any of its affiliates, neither Broadcom Corporation nor any of its affiliates has consented to or authorized (i) the incorporation of such Components in, or the use of such Components in combination with, any other products or components, (ii) LICENSEE’s sale of any products incorporating such Components, or (iii) the distribution in any jurisdiction of such Components where the distribution of such Components is deemed to be a putting on the market with Broadcom Corporation’s consent or authorization so as to effectuate an exhaustion of rights of any patents. The foregoing shall not modify or abrogate LICENSEE’s obligations under any existing license agreement between LICENSEE and Broadcom Corporation (or any of its affiliates), including but not limited to LICENSEE’s obligation to pay all royalties and fees specified thereunder, and shall not expand or alter LICENSEE’s rights thereunder.
